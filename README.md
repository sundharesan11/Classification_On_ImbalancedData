# Classification_On_ImbalancedData

Imblanced Data Challenge
### Challenge:
The motive of this imbalanced data challenge is to identify the imbalanced data problems and tackle them using class weighting and resampling methods in the following datasets:

1.Credit Card Fraud Detection

2.Predicting Customer Churn

3.Predicting Job Change

### Objective:

1. To apply Class Re-weighting method to adjust the impacts of different classes in model training processes.

2.To apply Oversampling and Undersampling to generate synthetic datasets and rebalance classes.

3.To evaluate the consolidated classifiers using robust metrics such as F-score and AUC.
